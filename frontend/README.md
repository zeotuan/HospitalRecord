# Hospital Record FrontEnd

This is the client for Hospital Record application

## ✔️ Requirements

Node (versions `14.15.5` are tested, but later versions _might_ work as well) and npm. If you haven't installed Node or npm, [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is an easy to use tool for installing both. Npm is also handy if you want to quickly switch between different Node versions.

## 🚀 Getting started

1.  cd in the `frontend` directory and run `npm install` .

2. run `npm start` to start the client. Open http://localhost:3000/api to view it in the browser. You should set up the  backend api first before starting the client. guide for setting up the backend can be found [Here](https://github.com/zeotuan/HospitalRecord/blob/main/patientor-backend/README.md)

## 🏗️ Building 
run `npm build` in order to create a build for production.
